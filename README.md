# Forget Specific History Chrome Extension

The Forget Specific History allows you to specify specific URLs or patterns to remove from your history and never save.

**This is currently in development!! It has not been released yet**

## Summary

What's the middle ground between incognito mode and full blown browsing with history? It's the Forget Specific History Chrome extension!

This allows you to specify root domains (like yahoo.com, youtube.com, or another po-based or you-based website you visit) that are not saved in your history.  Therefore you can still use your browser like normal but you don't have to feel embarrassed if a history or auto complete URL shows up when others are watching your screen.

## Usage

* Install the extension
* Go to the options page - or click the extension icon and click 'options'
* Enter a few domains you don't want to appear in your history
* Click save

Now you're good to go!

## Warnings

This does not protect you from any malware or websites you may visit. It simply removes an entry after it's made in your history matching a set of patterns. This does not disguise your browsing.

This syncs your URLs across your devices if you're using the same profile.  It does not retroactively go into your history and remove entries you've added. It's only active while you're using it on that particular device.
